This repo is to reproduce the results in this project: 

A meta-analysis of periodic and aperiodic M/EEG components in Parkinsonâ€™s disease

https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.07.07.663454

To process EEG datasets, use Processing_EEG files

To process MEG datasets, use Processing_MEG files

For generating Figure 2, run Figures.ipynb

After extracting the biomarkers, use forest_plot.R to generate Figure 3
